# What is Transaction?
- A group of task
- In database, a group of task that changes the database state

ACID is an acronym that refers to the group of 4 properties that define a transaction: **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Reliability**, and **Durability**.

### Atomicity

- A transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single group.
- So, all the changes are performed, or none of them are.

### Consistency

- Data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends.
- Transactions only make changes to tables in predefined, predictable ways.
- Consistency ensures that corruption or errors in your data do not create unintended consequences for the integrity of your table.

### Isolation

- Multiple users are reading and writing from the same table all at once, isolation of their transactions ensures that the concurrent transactions donâ€™t interfere with or affect one another.
- As a result, transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized.

### **Durability**

- After a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist and are not undone, even in the event of a system failure.

# **Why are ACID transactions a good thing to have?**

- Ensure the highest data reliability and integrity.
- Ensure that your data never falls into an inconsistent state because of an operation that partially completes.
