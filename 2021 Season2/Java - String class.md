# Java - String class

- String class has been used quite often among Java developers. One backend developer shared his experience that as he monitored web application performance one of the most created object is String(String is in Top 5 as always).
- This class provides the addition between instances only.

# Concept

```java
public **final** classString
extendsObject
implements Serializable,Comparable<String>,CharSequence
```

# Constructors

- First of all, among them there are two deprecated constructors
    - String(byte[] ascii, int hibyte)
    - String(byte[] ascii, int hibyte, int offset, int count)
- In terms of String(), it is useless to construct without any String parameter. In that case, we should use 'String name = null' instead.
- Also, as you know if the instance of String type would be null, you should check 'Null' condition in your source code.

    ```java
    public static boolean nullCheck(String text) {
    	if(text == null) {
    		return true;
    	} else {
    		return false;
    	}
    }
    ```

# Methods

- [Java Constant Pool](https://velog.io/@pranne1224/Java-Constant-Pool)

    It contains the constants that are needed to run the code of a specific class. This is runtime data structure similar to the symbol table. 

    It is important to note that constant pool starts from index 1. If it is index 0, it means invalid.

    Example

    ```java
    public class ConstantPool {
        
        public void sayHello() {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
    ```

    ```html
    #13 = Utf8               ConstantPool.java
    #17 = Utf8               Hello World
    #18 = Class              #25            // java/io/PrintStream
    #26 = Utf8               println
    ```

♨️Notice♨️

You should not use 'intern()' method to make String object which is generated by new String() command move to JVM constant pool. This can make your application so slow. It would affect the performance definitely.

# StringBuffer VS StringBuilder

- String is 'immutable' type. This means that we cannot reuse String type variable.

```java
String text = "text"; // No longer use "text" variable.
text += "world!"; 
```

- We often use StringBuffer(**Thread Safe**) & StringBuilder(**Thread Safe X**) instead.
- In Java SDK ver.5 or over, compiler switches '+' operator between String variables to .append() operator like StringBuffer or StringBuilder uses.
