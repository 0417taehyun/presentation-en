## Atomic Design

- Methodology, similar to natureüçÉ, for creating design systems

## 5 Distinct Levels

five distinct levels in atomic design

### 1. Atoms

- basic building block
- HTML tags, such as a form label, an input, or a button.
- abstract and often not useful on their own
- Atoms should not have margin or position value

### 2. Molecules

- groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound
- have their own properties

- molecules can be complex, as a rule of thumb they are relatively simple combinations of atoms built for **reuse**.

### 3. Organisms

- groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface

- Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, **reusable** components

### 4. Templates

- consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages

- very concrete and **provide context** to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.
- where clients start seeing the final design in place
- templates begin their life as HTML **wireframe**s, but over time increase fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable.

### 5. Pages

- specific instances of templates.
- real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.

- the highest level of fidelity and because they‚Äôre the most tangible
