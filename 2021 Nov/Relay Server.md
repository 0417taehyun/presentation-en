_Couldn't find exact definition, but as the word points, servers receive, and transfer data just like the relay runners. We call servers with this role as **Relay Server**._

# Example usage1. SMTP Relay

- SMTP refers to the “Simple Message Transfer Protocol.”
- Process or protocol of transferring emails between servers on the way to their final destination.

In the picture above, the local post offices would be the SMTP servers and the email transfer that happens between them is what we call ‘relaying’.

Most businesses that need to send **mass email** to their customers use SMTP relay for ease of maintenance. An SMTP relay provider can help businesses and organizations deliver large volumes of email without getting them mislabeled as spam or running up against small sending limits.

# Example usage2. RTSP Relay

- RTSP refers to "Real Time Streaming Protocol."
